Banks primarily generate their revenue through loans. A significant portion of a bank's financial profile stems directly from the income generated by issuing loans. However, even after the bank carefully evaluates loan applications through a comprehensive verification and assessment process, there is no guarantee that the selected applicant is the most suitable candidate. Manual evaluation of loan applications can be time-consuming. To address this, banks are increasingly turning to machine learning to automate the entire assessment process. Implementing machine learning models allows for more accurate predictions of whether a particular applicant is a secure borrower. This automated approach offers significant advantages for both bank clients and potential borrowers, as it enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the loan approval process, benefiting all parties involved.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the loan eligibility of a candidate. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether loan eligibility is present or not.

The results of every applicant can be stored in any file using the decision tree technique. We'll determine whether the person is youthful, middle-aged, or elderly. This is how we will issue a loan.
